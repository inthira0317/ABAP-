🧩 Modern ABAP Practice – Hands-On Experience

I’m actively practicing Modern ABAP on SAP HANA, focusing on real development scenarios using:

CDS Views, Annotations, AMDP, and performance-optimized data modeling

RAP (Restful ABAP Programming Model) for building end-to-end, cloud-ready business services

Fiori Elements and OData V4 to deliver intuitive, metadata-driven UIs

SAP BTP for exploring cloud extensions, deployments, and modern SAP development workflows

This ongoing practice is helping me build a strong foundation in modern SAP application development, following clean-core principles and cloud-native patterns
